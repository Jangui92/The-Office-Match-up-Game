# The Office Match Up Game


## Game Detail Summary
A memory match up card game, with nostalgic memes and characters based off of the The Office tv show. 

## Game Rules
1. Player chooses two squares at a time to see if they match. If there is a match pictures disappear, if there is no match pictures flip back in place.
2. Points accumulate according to players matches. Game automatically resets after all matches are found.
3. Player has to match all 20 pairs in order to have a successful game.

## Game Functionality
This memory game is going to be a little similar to tic tac toe because it runs on a grid. I will be using if else statements for matching each picture as a pair so that when the player selects matching pictures the pictures will disappear and be added as points. If the player doesn't select matching pictures the pictures will flip back over.

## Credits
I will be crediting [duckduckgo.com](http://duckduckgo.com) for my picture source. They provide concise sizes of photos that I need to make the pictures uniformed on the grid. I used a google font called 'Special Elite' for my h2 element [Special Elite Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Special+Elite#standard-styles)
