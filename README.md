## Game Detail Summary
A memory match up card game, with nostalgic memes and characters based on "The Office" tv show. 

## Game Rules
1. Player chooses two squares at a time to see if they match. If there is a match pictures disappear, if there is no match pictures flip back in place.
2. Points accumulate according to players matches. Each pair is worth 10 points.
3. Game runs on a 2 minute timer. After timer stops board will disappear to disable players from continuing the game. 
3. Player has to match all 10 pairs in order to have a successful game.

## Game Functionality
For this memory game I prepared my array of squares ad assigned them images and did two of each so that they could be matches. I created functions for the board that will show a default picture before the player begins the game and another default picture for after the player finds a match and the squares disappear. The board contains a for loop to loop through the array and assign all the squares a default picture. Using an if else statement I set up my match function for when players find a match and what will happen if the squares do not match along with if player finds all the matches. I created a function to have the squares flip when you select them and last but not least a timer function to time the game and remove squares when time is up.

## Trello Board
I organized my ideas and what I want to execute priority-wise with my game. [trello board](https://trello.com/b/aA5vnCAV/mystery-game)
