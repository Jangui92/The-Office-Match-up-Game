# Mystery-Game
 A mystery game made with javascript for project 
 
Time Capsule

<!-- Game Detail Summary -->
A memory game with nostalgic characters to match up. It will first start at a simple level consisting of 5 pairs, a total of 10 cards. and once the player matches the cards up properly they will be introduced to a second level that consists of 10 pairs, a total of 20 cards. I will utilize my secondary HTML page for the second level to put it to good use. The game will run on a timer. The player will have 3 minutes to complete the puzzle or it will trigger a banner that says "Out of Time!".

<!-- Game Functionality -->
This memory game is going to be a little similar to tic tac toe because it runs on a grid. I will be using if else statements for matching each picture as a pair so that when the player selects matching pictures the pictures will disappear and be added as points. If the player doesn't select matching pictures the pictures will flip back over.

<!-- CREDITS -->
I will be crediting flaticon.com for my picture source. They provide concise sizes of photos that I need to make the pictures uniformed on the grid.
